This deep learning model tackle the problem of movielens data set

I used emebedding layer for text data with residual connections to improve efficiency.
As expected it outsmarted the traditional model with 75% accuracy.

Moreover this model take each distinct input seperately and process it before merging which gives us the noise reduction and normalized data in each input.
